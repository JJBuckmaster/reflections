What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You begin the process of creating metadata - you are telling git you want to keep a track of these files - who changed what and when
Otherwise they just float around with no metadata being tagged

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory = All the files you're working on
Repository = All the files you've committed
Staging area = intermediate area between them - can do incremental commits to group together logical groups of files all related to the same change e.g. bug fix = helps track back any problems
Also helps with memory/processing - commits will be quicker incrementally than all files at once
