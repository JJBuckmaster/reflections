When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To allow other people to work on it
To allow you to work remotely e.g. away from your main machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The remote repository might be being used by someone working on experimental work
The remote repository might try to overwrite changes being worked on locally - cause conflicts
